On April 21, the Board of Supervisors strengthened its existing ordinance to include a moratorium on evictions for non-payment of rent and no-fault reasons during the state of emergency. This applies to tenants and homeowners alike. For tenants who are financially impacted by the coronavirus crisis, the ordinance allows a 12-month repayment period without late fees. Under the ordinance, no documentation is required of a tenant or homeowner to stop an eviction proceeding. However, if you provide documentation that you have a COVID-related impact, your eviction protection is absolute and there are no exceptions. At the end of 12 months, any remaining back rent is converted into a consumer debt. But impacted tenants can never be evicted for their inability to pay rent during the emergency period. In order to qualify for these protections, tenants must provide documentation or a sworn statement demonstrating financial hardship within 45 days of receiving a request from their landlord or 30 days of the end of the state of emergency, whichever is later. These protections extend to all cities and unincorporated areas of the County alike.

Lockouts for nonpayment of rent can also be done starting July 1.

Sept. 1: Residential tenants can be evicted for nonpayment of rent included what may be back owed to a landlord.  Residential mortgages can also begin to be foreclosed upon.

Late fees or penalties for non-payment of rent or mortgage payments may not be charged retroactively. The directive reinstates residential summary evictions and unlawful detainer actions prior to September 1 for certain causes other than non-payment of rent.

But, despite persistent calls from tenant advocates urging Cuomo to cancel rent during the public health crisis, protections have been gradually peeled back. Since then, the governor quietly issued an executive order easing restrictions on new eviction cases, but guidance from the courts stalls proceedings in those cases until at least through August 5. This is just the latest twist in a months-long saga of executive orders that have reshaped eviction protections for New Yorkers, leaving tenants and attorneys alike exasperated. All eviction proceedings and pending eviction orders shall be suspended statewide in New York until further notice. In NYC, all city marshals have been notified that they can not execute any pre-existing warrants. Initially, New York Chief Administrative Judge Lawrence Marks announced a suspension on court eviction proceedings, but a loophole briefly allowed landlords to file new eviction cases. A March executive order from Gov. Andrew Cuomo closed that loophole by blocking new cases until at least April 19 (that has since been extended to June 6) and enacting a statewide eviction moratorium until June 20. A new executive order, issues in May, extended that moratorium to August 20, but only to tenants who qualify for unemployment benefits or who are experiencing a “financial hardship” as a result of COVID-19, potentially putting the onus on tenants to prove that they are entitled to not be sued or evicted. The Eviction Moratorium is set to expire on August 5th. At the same time, the governor also rolled back protections prohibiting new residential eviction cases for both nonpayment of rent and foreclosure on residential mortgages. (Though, he has let that provision stand for commercial tenants.) Instead, the governor is relying on the Tenant Safe Harbor Act — which provides residential tenants with a defense they can use in court, but does not block new cases from being filed — to serve as New Yorkers’ remaining COVID-19-related protection from eviction.",https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/righttocounselnyc/pages/200/attachments/original/1589223332/Response_to_Executive_Order_202.28__May_11__2020_.pdf?1589223332,https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/righttocounselnyc/pages/200/attachments/original/1589223332/Response_to_Executive_Order_202.28__May_11__2020_.pdf?1589223332,NA,NA,2020-08-20T00:00:00Z,NA,2020-08-05T00:00:00Z,2020-05-06T00:17:35Z,azad,aemp,NA,Yes,State // Estado,NA,NA,NA,No,2020-04-16T00:00:00Z,2020-07-30T00:00:00Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,2020-03-20T00:00:00Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2020-08-05T00:00:00Z,Not specified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In NYC, all city marshals have been notified that they can not execute any pre-existing warrants. Initially, New York Chief Administrative Judge Lawrence Marks announced a suspension on court eviction proceedings, but a loophole briefly allowed landlords to file new eviction cases. A March executive order from Gov. Andrew Cuomo closed that loophole by blocking new cases until at least April 19 (that has since been extended to June 6) and enacting a statewide eviction moratorium until June 20. A new executive order, issues in May, extended that moratorium to August 20, but only to tenants who qualify for unemployment benefits or who are experiencing a “financial hardship” as a result of COVID-19, potentially putting the onus on tenants to prove that they are entitled to not be sued or evicted.  A statewide eviction moratorium ends August 5th for tenants whose cases were adjudicated before the COVID-19 crisis, leaving roughly 14,000 New York City households at risk of becoming homeless this month. A state measure known as the Tenants Safe Harbor Act protects tenants who prove they were financially impacted by the COVID-19 economic fallout, but does not apply to renters whose eviction cases were settled pre-pandemic.

Additionally, landlords are not allowed to raise rent by more than 3.5%, and cannot charge late fees if a tenant is too sick to pay rent, or has lost income due to the pandemic.

We are demanding not only a moratorium on rent, mortgage, and utility payments during this crisis but also universal debt forgiveness for any missed payments. The swiftly rising rent and consistently high eviction rates in Richmond make clear that workers struggle to make rent even under ideal conditions with ample available work. Should workers experience a disruption to their work schedule and subsequent lack of income, paying multiple months of rent will not be feasible, making the demand for debt forgiveness an essential aspect of a responsible community response to COVID-19. As Richmond has the second highest eviction rate in the country, at 11% annually, it is also critical that the city halt all evictions and foreclosures until the pandemic has ended. Eviction alone is a traumatic attack on people's health and wellbeing based on their financial status. In the context of a pandemic, eviction is a court-mandated sentence to sickness and death.

The tenant was unable to pay rent because of financial impacts related to COVID-19. While the Mayor’s Order provides a six-month extension on rent payments that become due during the Eviction Moratorium, the Rent Ordinance was amended by the Board of Supervisors on July 27, 2020 to provide further eviction protections for tenants. The amendments provide that no tenant may be evicted for non-payment of rent that become due while the Governor’s Executive Order on evictions is in effect (currently March 16, 2020 through September 30, 2020, unless extended), even if the rent is not paid after the Mayor’s six-month extension period expires. In other words, it creates a permanent eviction moratorium for missed rent payments that became due during the Governor’s Executive Order on evictions. Note that the legislation is currently being challenged in court, and only limits a landlord’s ability to evict. Thus, a landlord may still bring a civil action in court to collect the unpaid rent.  In order for the permanent eviction protections to apply, the tenant’s inability to pay rent must (a) arise out of a substantial decrease in household income, (b) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or by any local, state, or federal government response to COVID-19, and (c) be documented.  The second part of the Mayor’s Order temporarily bans all residential evictions if the effective date of the eviction notice would fall within 60 days after the Mayor’s Order expires. As of the date of this publication, the Mayor’s Order is set to expire on August 31, 2020, which means the eviction moratorium is currently effective through October 30, 2020. On March 18, 2020, the San Francisco Superior Court stayed all actions of unlawful detainer cases (eviction lawsuits) for 90 days, until June 19, 2020, and ordered that the period from March 18, 2020, through June 19, 2020 is deemed a court holiday for purposes of computing time under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1167, except for evictions resulting from violence, threats of violence, or health and safety issues.

Tenants who use this defense are required to share that information with their landlord to support claims for any prospective mortgage relief.

As of April 1, the new bill extends the state’s ban on evictions for both residential and commercial properties until Sept. 30 and gives renters until March 31, 2021 to pay back their outstanding nonpayment balances. Brown’s original order did not include a grace period to pay back-rent.
Landlords will not be allowed to charge late fees or report nonpayment balances as delinquent to consumer credit reporting agencies during the moratorium, but renters will still be obligated to eventually pay back any missed rental payments.
The order only bars police from enforcing evictions due to nonpayment of rent for a period of ninety days, but evictions for failing a rental inspection, noise complaints or any other thing deemed as a lease violation may still be served. The order makes no space for a longer repayment schedule while numerous banks have publicly given 12-month extensions to their mortgage holders, nor does this order address the need for a Nationwide Rent Freeze or Suspension to keep out of work renters from accruing mass amounts of debt.",https://oregonlawhelp.org/files/CCDACC15-944D-570E-7F1F-7BBF3DEC0018/attachments/CEB3A3AF-346D-4648-94D8-A59DB61FD7F9/olc-laso-eviction-moratorium-updates-7-1-20.pdf,https://oregonlawhelp.org/issues/covid-19-resources/housing-protections,NA,Yes // Si // 是,2020-09-30T00:00:00Z,NA,NA,2020-08-04T17:37:31Z,Sachi,aemp,NA,Yes // Si // 想,State // Estado // 州,NA,NA,NA,Yes // Si // 是,2020-06-26T00:00:00Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,New campaign or protection that isn't listed //Nueva campaña o protección que no está en la lista Nueva campaña o protección que no está en la lista Nueva campaña o protección que no está en la lista // 未列出的新活动,NA,NA,NA,"Yes, evictions are still possible for reasons other than non-payment of rent.",NA,NA,"Tenants have until March 31st 2021 to repay rent due between April 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

No matter your situation, be sure to: 

Gather proof of financial hardship – this can be a termination letter, an email from your employer or some other information that proves you lost wages because of COVID-19.

Keeping track of missed payments will help protect your credit score and financial standing in the future. Rely only on communication directly from your mortgage provider, your landlord, the City of Memphis or trustworthy organizations like United Housing.
