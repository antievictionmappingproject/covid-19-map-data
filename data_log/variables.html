Governor Eric Holcomb ordered that evictions and foreclosure actions/proceedings may not be brought March 19, 2020 until the executive order declaring a state of emergency in Indiana is halted by the governor. The Supreme Court of Indiana issued clarifying guidance that filings are still being accepted, and urging courts to consider public health, safety, and property values when using their discretion to decide whether to stay non-emergency proceedings. The governor's order also requests that public housing authorities extend deadlines for housing assistance recipients or applicants. Finally, each circuit and superior court in Indiana has issued a slightly different version suspending most civil proceedings although none of these applied explictly to eviction proceedings or foreclosures. The majority of districts suspended all civil hearings from 2 weeks up to 1.5 months while the minority of districts suspended only in person hearings/civil jury trials but allowed for teleconferencing or alternative methods for continuing non-essential business.
