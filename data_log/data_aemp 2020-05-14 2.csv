The city has also created an affirmative defense for evictions for non-payment of rent for tenants who can't afford to pay because of the pandemicâ€”for example, because their hours were cut, their business closed, they were laid off, or they have extreme medical costs related to COVID-19. To be protected, tenants have 30 days after rent is due to provide written notice to the landlord (including emails of texts) that they cannot pay rent, and must provide documentation to support their claim (such as pay stubs, time cards, proof of medical care or quarantine, or notices from employers or schools). This order includes pending evictions where the tenant is still living in the home. After the order ends, tenants will have six months to make up the rent they couldn't pay during the emergency, and will not have to pay any late fees.",http://ww2.cityofpasadena.net/councilagendas/2020%20Agendas/Mar_30_2020/AR.24%20CORRECTED%20ORDINANCE.pdf,Yes,Existing tenant protection,Yes,California,City // Ciudad,Pasadena,NA,NA,NA,Yes,Moratorium (landlords are not allowed to serve notices to tenants),"No-fault evictions (evictions that are not based on anything the tenant did), Evictions for non-payment of rent related to COVID-19",Yes,Within 30 days after rent is due,"Yes, but email or text is okay",Yes,When they notify their landlord,Not specified,"No, they can't charge late fees or interest",NA,I don't know,2020-03-27T00:00:00Z,2020-05-31T00:00:00Z,I'm done!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6 months,0,1,0,1,1,0
