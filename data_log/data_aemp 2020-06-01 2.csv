We've called our 5 point demand platform ""A Pandemic Platform for the People of Richmond."" The Tenant Protection section reads as follows: ""With pandemic-related disruptions to work schedules, combined with a lack of paid time off, workers will not be able to pay rent, mortgages, or utilities. We are demanding not only a moratorium on rent, mortgage, and utility payments during this crisis but also universal debt forgiveness for any missed payments. The swiftly rising rent and consistently high eviction rates in Richmond make clear that workers struggle to make rent even under ideal conditions with ample available work. Should workers experience a disruption to their work schedule and subsequent lack of income, paying multiple months of rent will not be feasible, making the demand for debt forgiveness an essential aspect of a responsible community response to COVID-19. As Richmond has the second highest eviction rate in the country, at 11% annually, it is also critical that the city halt all evictions and foreclosures until the pandemic has ended. Eviction alone is a traumatic attack on people's health and wellbeing based on their financial status. In the context of a pandemic, eviction is a court-mandated sentence to sickness and death. We must immediately end such unnecessary cruelty.""",Richmond Tenants Union,https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/a-pandemic-platform-for-the-people-of-richmond,Yes,Active campaign,Yes,Virginia,City // Ciudad,Richmond,NA,NA,NA,"No, I want to share something about rental relief policies, court process / law enforcement policy or something else",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,I'm done!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

These defenses can be used retroactively for evictions filed since 3/4/2020. To be protected against eviction for non-payment of rent, tenants must notify their landlords within 7 days after rent is due that they can't afford to pay.
