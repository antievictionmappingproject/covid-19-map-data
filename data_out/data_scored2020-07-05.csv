Landlords also may not impose new ""pass-throughs"" (charging tenants to make up the cost of various fees or capital improvements.) Tenants and mobile home owners have an affirmative defense on 1) no-fault evictions, except those deemed necessary for health and safety; 2) evictions for non-payment of rent for tenants who can't afford to pay because of the pandemic; and 3) evictions based on unauthorized occupants, pets, or nuisance related to the pandemic (for example, if a tenant has to take in a family member or pet and there is additional noise as a result.) These defenses can be used retroactively for evictions filed since 3/4/2020. To be protected against eviction for non-payment of rent, tenants must notify their landlords within 7 days after rent is due that they can't afford to pay. If tenants cannot provide documentation to support their claim, they may submit a self-certification instead, which landlords are required to accept. After the order ends, tenants will have 12 months to make up any rent they couldn't pay during the emergency, and will not have to pay interest or late fees. The county encourages landlords to agree to a repayment plan. The order explicitly bans landlords and their agents from harassing or intimidating tenants based on any of the issues described here.

We've called our 5 point demand platform ""A Pandemic Platform for the People of Richmond."" The Tenant Protection section reads as follows: ""With pandemic-related disruptions to work schedules, combined with a lack of paid time off, workers will not be able to pay rent, mortgages, or utilities. We are demanding not only a moratorium on rent, mortgage, and utility payments during this crisis but also universal debt forgiveness for any missed payments. The swiftly rising rent and consistently high eviction rates in Richmond make clear that workers struggle to make rent even under ideal conditions with ample available work. Should workers experience a disruption to their work schedule and subsequent lack of income, paying multiple months of rent will not be feasible, making the demand for debt forgiveness an essential aspect of a responsible community response to COVID-19. As Richmond has the second highest eviction rate in the country, at 11% annually, it is also critical that the city halt all evictions and foreclosures until the pandemic has ended. Eviction alone is a traumatic attack on people's health and wellbeing based on their financial status. In the context of a pandemic, eviction is a court-mandated sentence to sickness and death. We must immediately end such unnecessary cruelty.""",,https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/a-pandemic-platform-for-the-people-of-richmond,Richmond Tenants Union,Eviction Cases can Resume (Remote or In-Person),The Governor's eviction moratorium expired on 6/28 with the passage of a $50 million rent and foreclosure relief program (RMRP).

,,Sweden,Country,,,TRUE,,,,,"The Swedish Tenants’ Association has been receiving signals of an increased worry among its members who fear they will not be able to make rent payments on time (or at all) due to sudden loss of income. The association has therefore advocated for a national tenants’ fund and rent reductions. According to the chairwoman of the association, Marie Linder, those who are most likely to be heavily affected by the crisis (e.g. those working in hotels, restaurants, or the tourism sector more broadly) are also more likely to be renting. Martin Hofverberg, Chief Economist at the Swedish Tenants’ Association, has also suggested increasing the housing allowance in light of the current situation. This is a solution that is shared by the Property Owners’ Association’s CEO Reinhold Lennebo, who agrees that national policy has often prioritised homeownership over tenancy.
The Swedish Association of Property Owners recommend voluntary measures to be decided on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the property owner, including:  Collect rents as per usual but suspend the automatic conversion of overdue payments into debt collection; Meet with tenants who have been financially impacted by the outbreak on an individual basis and decide together what to do about rent payments in coming months; Convert the portion of the rent that cannot be paid at this time into a debt and agree on a payment plan for this debt with the tenant in question; Avoid general (all-encompassing) rent reductions and prioritise finding solutions on a case-by-case basis. 
There are existing protections that come into play: In case of serious illness: For tenants who fall ill from covid-19 there are protections under Swedish tenancy law (hyreslagen) that allow the tenant to keep their tenancy despite late rent, on the grounds of illness. This applies when the tenant is prevented from paying rent as a direct consequence of the illness (for example due to intensive care) and if the tenant is committed to paying rent as soon as possible. In case of sudden loss of income: For people who experience a sudden and unforeseeable loss of income, due to illness or loss of employment, there are support mechanisms in place to ensure this person’s continued social welfare. Per the Swedish Social Services Act (socialtjänstlagen), it is a municipal responsibility to ensure citizens’ material security, which includes financial assistance for rent payments. Paid “disease carrier” leave (Smittbärarpenning): up to 80% of income (but difficult to see how this can be used for such an unexpectedly large number of people).",National,https://www.iut.nu/country/sweden/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SWE,1,,,,,FALSE
