,,Sweden,Country,,,TRUE,"The Swedish Tenants’ Association has been receiving signals of an increased worry among its members who fear they will not be able to make rent payments on time (or at all) due to sudden loss of income. The association has therefore advocated for a national tenants’ fund and rent reductions. According to the chairwoman of the association, Marie Linder, those who are most likely to be heavily affected by the crisis (e.g. those working in hotels, restaurants, or the tourism sector more broadly) are also more likely to be renting. Martin Hofverberg, Chief Economist at the Swedish Tenants’ Association, has also suggested increasing the housing allowance in light of the current situation. This is a solution that is shared by the Property Owners’ Association’s CEO Reinhold Lennebo, who agrees that national policy has often prioritised homeownership over tenancy.
The Swedish Association of Property Owners recommend voluntary measures to be decided on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the property owner, including:  Collect rents as per usual but suspend the automatic conversion of overdue payments into debt collection; Meet with tenants who have been financially impacted by the outbreak on an individual basis and decide together what to do about rent payments in coming months; Convert the portion of the rent that cannot be paid at this time into a debt and agree on a payment plan for this debt with the tenant in question; Avoid general (all-encompassing) rent reductions and prioritise finding solutions on a case-by-case basis. 
There are existing protections that come into play: In case of serious illness: For tenants who fall ill from covid-19 there are protections under Swedish tenancy law (hyreslagen) that allow the tenant to keep their tenancy despite late rent, on the grounds of illness. This applies when the tenant is prevented from paying rent as a direct consequence of the illness (for example due to intensive care) and if the tenant is committed to paying rent as soon as possible. In case of sudden loss of income: For people who experience a sudden and unforeseeable loss of income, due to illness or loss of employment, there are support mechanisms in place to ensure this person’s continued social welfare. Per the Swedish Social Services Act (socialtjänstlagen), it is a municipal responsibility to ensure citizens’ material security, which includes financial assistance for rent payments.
