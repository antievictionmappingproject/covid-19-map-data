We are demanding not only a moratorium on rent, mortgage, and utility payments during this crisis but also universal debt forgiveness for any missed payments. The swiftly rising rent and consistently high eviction rates in Richmond make clear that workers struggle to make rent even under ideal conditions with ample available work. Should workers experience a disruption to their work schedule and subsequent lack of income, paying multiple months of rent will not be feasible, making the demand for debt forgiveness an essential aspect of a responsible community response to COVID-19. As Richmond has the second highest eviction rate in the country, at 11% annually, it is also critical that the city halt all evictions and foreclosures until the pandemic has ended. Eviction alone is a traumatic attack on people's health and wellbeing based on their financial status. In the context of a pandemic, eviction is a court-mandated sentence to sickness and death.

Additional measures relating to the protection of commercial tenants were added on June 4, 2020.

The object of the Bill is to provide acceleration measures for a period of two years following its assent with respect to projects that are most conducive to restarting Québec’s economy, including the construction of seniors’ homes, residential and long-term care centres, public transit systems, roads and schools. The Bill would suspend, during the period beginning on the date on which the Bill is enacted and ending on August 1, 2020 (or any other date specified by the government), the rights of landlords to terminate commercial leases, seize goods contained therein or register prior notices of exercise of hypothecary rights in the event of non-payment of rent due after March 13, 2020.

,,Sweden,Country,,,TRUE,,,,,"The Swedish Tenants’ Association has been receiving signals of an increased worry among its members who fear they will not be able to make rent payments on time (or at all) due to sudden loss of income. The association has therefore advocated for a national tenants’ fund and rent reductions. According to the chairwoman of the association, Marie Linder, those who are most likely to be heavily affected by the crisis (e.g. those working in hotels, restaurants, or the tourism sector more broadly) are also more likely to be renting. Martin Hofverberg, Chief Economist at the Swedish Tenants’ Association, has also suggested increasing the housing allowance in light of the current situation. This is a solution that is shared by the Property Owners’ Association’s CEO Reinhold Lennebo, who agrees that national policy has often prioritised homeownership over tenancy.
The Swedish Association of Property Owners recommend voluntary measures to be decided on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the property owner, including:  Collect rents as per usual but suspend the automatic conversion of overdue payments into debt collection; Meet with tenants who have been financially impacted by the outbreak on an individual basis and decide together what to do about rent payments in coming months; Convert the portion of the rent that cannot be paid at this time into a debt and agree on a payment plan for this debt with the tenant in question; Avoid general (all-encompassing) rent reductions and prioritise finding solutions on a case-by-case basis. 
There are existing protections that come into play: In case of serious illness: For tenants who fall ill from covid-19 there are protections under Swedish tenancy law (hyreslagen) that allow the tenant to keep their tenancy despite late rent, on the grounds of illness. This applies when the tenant is prevented from paying rent as a direct consequence of the illness (for example due to intensive care) and if the tenant is committed to paying rent as soon as possible. In case of sudden loss of income: For people who experience a sudden and unforeseeable loss of income, due to illness or loss of employment, there are support mechanisms in place to ensure this person’s continued social welfare. Per the Swedish Social Services Act (socialtjänstlagen), it is a municipal responsibility to ensure citizens’ material security, which includes financial assistance for rent payments. Paid “disease carrier” leave (Smittbärarpenning): up to 80% of income (but difficult to see how this can be used for such an unexpectedly large number of people).",National,https://www.iut.nu/country/sweden/,orttillort.wordpress.com/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SWE,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
