  / Shiny 1.4 bumped jQuery from 1.x to 3.x which means jQuery's
  / on-ready handler (i.e., $(fn)) is now asyncronous (i.e., it now
  / really means $(setTimeout(fn)).
  / https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#breaking-change-document-ready-handlers-are-now-asynchronous
  /
  / Since Shiny uses $() to schedule initShiny, shiny>=1.4 calls initShiny
  / one tick later than it did before, which means staticRender() is
  / called renderValue() earlier than (advanced) widget authors might be expecting.
  / https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/2630
  /
  / For a concrete example, leaflet has some methods (e.g., updateBounds)
  / which reference Shiny methods registered in initShiny (e.g., setInputValue).
  / Since leaflet is privy to this life-cycle, it knows to use setTimeout() to
  / delay execution of those methods (until Shiny methods are ready)
  / https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/blob/18ec981/javascript/src/index.js#L266-L268
  /
  / Ideally widget authors wouldn't need to use this setTimeout() hack that
  / leaflet uses to call Shiny methods on a staticRender(). In the long run,
  / the logic initShiny should be broken up so that method registration happens
  / right away, but binding happens later.

Alabama has also suspended in-person civil cases throughout the state, which should apply to evictions and foreclosures, although it does allow remote proceedings. Alabama did not implemented statewide orders that to prevent the inititaion of evictions, and continued to allow remote hearings. Cities/counties in the state have shied away from explicitly addressing evictions. However, several utility companies have announced that they will not suspend services to customers during the crisis in Birmingham, Decatur, Mobile, and Piedmont.","Moratorium on evictions of residential and commercial tenants who demonstrate COVID-19 related inabilities to pay rents. Also bans residential no-fault evictions for owner move-in or capital improvements. Any tenant unable to pay rent shall take all reasonable steps to timely inform the landlord and, to the extent feasible, make reasonable reduced rent payments commensurate with the tenant's reduced income and financial ability to do so. Tenants will have 180 days to pay any rent deferred from 3/1/20 through 30 days (210 days total) following the end of the statewide or local emergencies, whichever ends first.  Freeze on rent increases for residential rent controlled units (e.g., pre-1995 multi-family units, but not single-family homes, condos or Section 8) until 1/1/21.","Alameda County closed its Eviction Court until April 7th and the Sheriff’s Department suspended all eviction enforcement for the time being. On April 21, the Board of Supervisors strengthened its existing ordinance to include a moratorium on evictions for non-payment of rent and no-fault reasons during the state of emergency. This applies to tenants and homeowners alike. For tenants who are financially impacted by the coronavirus crisis, the ordinance allows a 12-month repayment period without late fees. At the end of 12 months, any remaining back rent is converted into a consumer debt. But impacted tenants can never be evicted for their inability to pay rent during the emergency period. In order to qualify for these protections, tenants must provide documentation or a sworn statement demonstrating financial hardship within 45 days of receiving a request from their landlord or 30 days of the end of the state of emergency, whichever is later. These protections extend to all cities and unincorporated areas of the County alike. This means that renters in cities that have not passed local ordinances, like Dublin, are now protected by the County ordinance. In cities with local ordinances, however, residents are protected by the stronger of the two laws.","Moratorium on eviction for nonpayment of rent until the date the governor determines, under sec. 2 of this Act, that the public health disaster emergency no longer exists, or until June 30, 2020, whichever is earlier.","Emergency moratorium on all no-fault evictions of residential tenants who demonstrate COVID-19 related inabilities to pay rents. Tenants must notify landlords in writing of inability to pay within 30 days after rent is due and provide documentation within that period. Tenants will have up to 6 months post-emergency to repay any back rent. Also imposes a rent increase moratorium on property not exempt from rent control per state law.","All evictions from city-owned properties are suspended.","Emergency moratorium on all no-fault evictions of residential and commercial tenants who demonstrate COVID-19 related inabilities to pay rents. Tenants must notify landlords in writing of inability to pay within 7 days after rent is due (unless there are extenuating circumstances), provide documentation and pay a portion due that 'tenant is able to pay'. Tenants will have up to 6 months post-emergency to repay any back rent. The eviction moratorium will remain in effect during the pay-back period.","All evictions—except those deemed public health threats, such as those involving allegations of violent crimes or drug-related felonies—have been stayed by the courts until June 1, 2020.

We are demanding not only a moratorium on rent, mortgage, and utility payments during this crisis but also universal debt forgiveness for any missed payments. The swiftly rising rent and consistently high eviction rates in Richmond make clear that workers struggle to make rent even under ideal conditions with ample available work. Should workers experience a disruption to their work schedule and subsequent lack of income, paying multiple months of rent will not be feasible, making the demand for debt forgiveness an essential aspect of a responsible community response to COVID-19. As Richmond has the second highest eviction rate in the country, at 11% annually, it is also critical that the city halt all evictions and foreclosures until the pandemic has ended.

Additional measures relating to the protection of commercial tenants were added on June 4, 2020.

Evictions proceedings are managed by each Superior Court at the local level. So while evictions actions can't be executed, they can still be filed and managed in court.

The rules also postpone trials for at least 60 days. The Governor has issued an executive order banning the enforcement of eviction orders, and tolling response time for new eviction complaints, for renters affected by COVID-19 through May 31, 2020. This order still allows for local governments to pass their own stricter eviction bans. The Governor issued an order giving local governments authority to halt evictions, slow foreclosures, and protect against utility shutoffs until September 30, 2020. Since then several local governments have adopted coronavirus-specific eviction restrictions. Most of these require tenants to provide documentation to verify that they are unable to pay rent due to financial impacts related to COVID-19.
